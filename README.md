# D7S-Library

This D7S Arduino Library is designed for interfacing with the Omron D7S seismic sensor. This library allows users to monitor seismic activity and identify earthquake intensity based on the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) intensity scale. It also provides instant access to Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) data during seismic events.

An example code is included in the library to demonstrate earthquake monitoring with intensity identification and a buzzer alarm system. The library supports event-driven programming, enabling efficient handling of seismic events and quick response to potential hazards.
